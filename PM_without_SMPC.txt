1) P+E, E attacks
2) attack applied to public-key based prediction markets
3) using hash functions instead of public/private keys
4) 2 types of accounts

1)

2) This attack requires the ability of the attacker to give money to the jury. If they jury has no public keys, then there is no one to give money to.

3) This alternative cryptography for securing funds has the property we need. It is impossible for coin-holders to prove their identity, unless they reveal both secrets. If they reveal both secrets, then they lose all their money.

Each account keeps 2 secrets. These secrets get revealed one at a time. Every time a secret is revealed, they generate a new secret, so that they still have 2.
Before publishing a spend tx=T, they need to publish a tx that contains hash(T).
Every time they publish any tx, they need to include hash(both secrets), and write their oldest secret onto the tx. 

Your txs are not valid until both secrets used in creating that tx are revealed.
