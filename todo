1) we need trading fees to reward the reputation holders and prediction-market creators.
2)conditional markets are supported, but in a limited way. We need to encode an entire matrix to do it correctly, I think.

make sure that trading fees are rewarded to authors and voters correctly.

Let users use liquidity-sensitive LMSR if they want.
