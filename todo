gmp for arithmetic speed? or maybe cdecimal would work even better.
cdecimal stuff:
You can get cdecimal via pip:
pip install --allow-external cdecimal cdecimal
And then to use it (in place of decimal), put this at the very beginning of your Python file (truth_cli.py):
import sys
try:
   import cdecimal
   sys.modules["decimal"] = cdecimal
except:
   pass
import decimal
